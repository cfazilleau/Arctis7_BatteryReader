# Arctis_BatteryReader

This repo is a fork of the original project Arctis7_BatteryReader by crazyklatsch.

I edited the code to make it more user friendly and adapted if to use with versionning. I also added support for other Arctis headsets.

A battery reader for the Steelseries Arctis Wireless Headsets. It polls the percentage every 5 seconds and displayes it as a tray icon.

It uses the MightyHID Library by twatorowski (https://github.com/MightyDevices/MightyHID).

# Download / Installation

See [Releases](https://github.com/cfazilleau/Arctis_BatteryReader/releases/latest).

# Original README message from crazyklatsch
```
I made all icons myself, so no copyright or smth. If you want to change them, I included the .xcf-file (Gimp 2: i always first exported to png and then only that png to icon).
I put this program into my autostart and it's a real enrichment to using the headset :)
I'm open for ideas to improve this project.
I'm not affiliated with Steelseries in any way and did this as a hobby project.

Have fun!
