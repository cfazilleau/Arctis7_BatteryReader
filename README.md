# Arctis7_BatteryReader
A battery reader for the Steelseries Arctis7 Wireless Headset. It polls the percentage and displayes it as a tray icon.

It uses the MightyHID Library by twatorowski (https://github.com/MightyDevices/MightyHID). You will have to download and build it and then set this projects Assembly reference to the built 'MightyHID.dll'. Another Assembly reference I had to set manually was to 'System.Windows.Forms'.

I'm not planning to change anything concerning this project, since it works fine for me. I just wanted to give other people a headstart when trying to accomplish this.

Have fun!
